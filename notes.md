#Notes

## Issue
npm does not have permission to overwrite the already created build folder. Meaning that if heroku erases the old build before creating the new, it would work. Or if I have permissions to replace the folder.

## ToDo
- [x] Translate commands from MS-DOS to BASH
- [ ] Test on heroku
- [ ] test a fetch from the client to the api on dev
- [ ] test that fetch on heroku
